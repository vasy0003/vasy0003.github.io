# Portfolio Website -Responsive Web Design

## Purpose
I created my personal website to bring the attention of potential clients by showing a digital portfolio of my works and identity.

## Challenges
I met some challenges while working on this project. One of the biggest problems was working with Bootstrap. My custom CSS was overwritten by the Bootstrap CSS. Even though I used bootstrap just on a few pages it took some time to fix the problem.

### How I fixed them

- I needed to override bootstrap styles. So, I was more specific in targeting elements.
- My own CSS stylesheet should be linked after the Bootstrap in this way the rules in my stylesheet have more precedence.

## What I learned

## I learned a lot. The first thing is that I can solve the problem by myself without tutors, but google and inspector tool are my best friends. At the beginning of responsive web course, I did not use inspector tool but working on my portfolio website I used inspector tool even more than actual CSS because it saves a lot of time when you want to apply some adjustment and/or find the problem and a lot more. It is an essential tool. Also, I realized that my mock-up includes a lot of nice-looking design element, but they are complicated from the developersâ€™ perspective. So, the lesson is that when designing a website, I will think not only about the look but also about developing process.
